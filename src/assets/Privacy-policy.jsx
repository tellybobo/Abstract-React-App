    >Our Approach To Privacy</h4>
   
   
   <p><span style={{marginRight: "15px"}}>1</span>Abstract is a version control software platform that allows you to upload, manage and <br /> grant other users permission to view and edit digital design documents, images and <br /> related materials (the <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>"Abstract Service"</span>).</p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "15px"}}><span style={{marginRight: "15px"}}>2</span>The Abstract Service is provided to you by Abstract Studio Design, Inc. (<span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>"Abstract", <br /> "we", "our", or "us".</span>). We are committed to protecting your privacy.

   <h1>Part 1 – Privacy Policy for non- <br />EEA users</h1>
   
   <p>This Part 1 of our privacy policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect <br /> information that is collected through the Abstract Service from users outside the <br /> European Economic Area or Switzerland, as well as your choices regarding the collection <br /> and use of information.</p>

   <h2 style={{fontSize: "2.5rem"}}>What Information do We Collect and for What <br /> Purpose?
</h2>
   <p>We collect personal information when you voluntarily submit information directly to us <br /> when you use the Service. We also collect personal information from you indirectly such <br /> as information about how you use the Service and the device you use to access the <br /> Service.</p>

   We will ask you to provide your payment information if you <br /> purchase any products or services on the Service, such as your credit or debit card <br /> number, cardholder name, expiry date and CVC number. We will use these details to <br /> process payment for the relevant services, to monitor and improve our site and our <br /> procedures and to help us develop new products and services. We will not store this <br /> information, but will provide it to Recurly, a third-party subscription service provider. <br /> Please refer to their website for more information about how they store your payment <br /> information (<Link to = "https://recurly.com">https://recurly.com/</Link>).

We will use this information in order <br /> to provide you with the appropriate level of access to materials and pages on the <br /> Service, to respond to queries, issues or concerns the Customer or other user raises, to <br /> assist other users who want to invite users to the Service or who want to share <br /> information about the Service.

We will also use comments and opinions you express when responding to <br /> surveys, entering competitions or taking part in other promotions to determine products <br /> and services that may be of interest to you and to send you marketing communications <br /> in accordance with your marketing preferences.</p>

   <h2 style={{fontSize: "2.5rem"}}>Third-party Tracking and Online Advertising</h2>

   <p>We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to <br /> serve you targeted advertisements based on your online browsing history and your <br /> interests. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies <br /> and other third party services, to collect, information about your use of our Service over time <br /> so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other websites, apps or services <br /> you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the <br /> information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar <br /> tracking technologies. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email <br /> address or user ID) or hashed data with our third party advertising partners to help <br /> identify you across devices. We and our third party partners use this information to make <br /> the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide <br /> advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market <br /> research.
   </p>

   <p>To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of <br /> some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online <br /> resources, at <br /> <Link>http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</Link>, and/or the DAA’s resources at <br /> <Link>www.aboutads.info/choices</Link>. You may also be able to set your browser to delete or notify <br /> you of cookies by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please <br /> note that some advertising opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to <br /> accept cookies. Furthermore, if you use a different device, change browsers or delete the <br /> opt-out cookies, you may need to perform the opt-out task again.  
</p>

<p>You may also be able to limit certain interest-based mobile advertising through the <br /> settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest <br /> based ads” (Android).</p>

We share a unique <br /> identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. <br />  Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Service <br /> and to tailor our advertisements and content to you.  For information on how Google <br /> Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to <br /> Google, review Google's site “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or <br /> apps” located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

   <h2 style={{fontSize: "2.5rem"}}>Tracking Technologies Used in our Emails</h2>
   
  <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>10.1</span>
  Our emails may contain tracking technologies that provide us with information about <br /> your interactions with our emails, including identifying if and when you have opened an <br /> email that we have sent you, how many times you have read it and whether you have <br /> clicked on any links in that email. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our <br /> marketing email campaigns, make the emails we send to you more relevant to your <br /> interests and to understand if you have opened and read any important administrative <br /> emails we might send you.

 </p>

  <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>10.2</span>
 Most popular email clients will allow you to block these technologies by disabling <br /> certain external images in emails. You can do this through the settings on your email client <br /> – these generally give you the option of choosing whether emails will display "remote <br /> images", "remote content" or "images" by default.
 </p>

  <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>10.3</span>
   Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and installing extensions <br /> that block tracking technologies.

   <h2 style={{fontSize: "2.5rem"}}>Marketing and Advertising</h2>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.1</span>
   From time to time we may contact you with information about our products and <br /> services. For some marketing messages, we may use personal information we collect <br /> about you to help determine the most relevant marketing information to share with you.
  </p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.2</span>
   Most marketing messages will be in the form of emails to the email address you <br /> provide to us. We will only send you these marketing messages if you have given us your <br /> consent to do so. If you want to stop receiving marketing messages, you can change your <br /> marketing preferences by following the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each marketing <br /> email you receive from us.
  </p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.3</span>
  We may allow third parties to deliver certain advertising about products and services <br /> that they believe may be of interest to you based on information about how you use the <br /> Abstract Service and data associated with your device via mobile advertising platforms. <br /> We may share information about your use of the Abstract Service with third party <br /> advertising companies for this purpose.
  </p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.4</span>
    Typically, but not always, this information is collected through cookies and similar <br /> tracking technologies. These third parties may collect mobile identifiers, such as the ID for <br /> Advertising for iOS (IDFA), Google Advertising ID, as well as your device's IP address, <br /> information about other applications on your device, your location, information about your <br /> use of the Abstract Service and information about which adverts you have seen or clicked <br /> on.
  </p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.5</span>
   You may be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your <br /> mobile device or on some PCs by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS), “opt-out of interest <br /> based ads” (Android) or by disabling access to your advertising ID in the Privacy settings <br /> on Windows 10. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able <br /> to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising <br /> Initiative’s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the <br /> DAA’s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices. Some social media websites, such as <br /> Facebook, also allow you to adjust your ad preferences, which might affect the advertising <br /> displayed to you. You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based <br /> ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and <br /> downloading the mobile AppChoices app.
  </p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.6</span>
  Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s <br /> and DAA’s or Your Online Choices online resources will only opt you out from receiving <br /> interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but you may still receive interest <br />-based ads on your other devices. You would need to perform the opt-out on each browser <br /> or device you use.
  </p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.7</span>
    Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept <br /> cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or devices, <br /> or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.
  </p>

   <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>11.8</span>
   Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will no <br /> longer see advertising on your device – it just means that adverts may no longer be <br /> tailored to your interests.
