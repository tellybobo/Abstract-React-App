    <p style={{marginTop: "25px"}}>These Customer Terms of Service (<span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Customer Terms”</span>) together with any documents <br /> referenced below (like our Privacy Policy) are, collectively, the “ <span style={{fontWeight: '700'}}>Agreement</span>.” As long as <br /> you comply with the Agreement, we will provide you with access to and use of our version <br /> control and design workflow management platform as well as downloadable software that <br /> facilitates the use of the platform (collectively, the “ <span style={{fontWeight : "700"}}>Services</span> ”).
   </p>

   
    <p style={{marginTop: "7px"}}>This Agreement is a legally binding contract between Abstract Studio Design, <br /> Inc. ( <span style={{fontWeight : "700"}}>“Abstract”, “we”, “us”, or “our”</span> ) and you, the person accessing and using Services <br /> (referred to throughout the Agreement as <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Customer,” “you” “your”, “yours” or <br /> “yourself”</span> ).  By clicking to accept the Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read <br /> and understood the Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms. <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>If you do not agree to <br /> be bound by the terms of the Agreement, you must not click that you accept or <br /> access or use the Services.</span>

   <h2 style={{marginTop: "15px"}}>Important information about <br /> the “Customer”</h2>
   
   
   <p>Some customers use our Services in connection with work for their employer, customers <br /> may also use our Services for their own, personal purposes. Thus, “Customer” (or “you” or <br /> “your”) may be either the business entity (or other organization that you represent) or you <br /> as an individual. If you are signed up for a subscription plan using your corporate email <br /> domain or are otherwise entering into a subscription plan on behalf of a business entity or <br /> other organization (e.g. to complete projects for your employer), the business entity or <br /> other organization on whose behalf you signed up is the Customer. By signing up on <br /> behalf of a business entity or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have <br /> all right, power, and authority to bind such entity or organization to the Agreement. If you <br /> signed up for a subscription to the Services and are not formally affiliated with a business <br /> entity or other organization (e.g. to use the Services for your own, personal purposes <br /> unaffiliated with your work for your employer), you, as an individual, are the Customer.

</p>

 <p style={{fontWeight: "700", marginTop: "7px"}}>You also understand and agree that if you sign up to use the Services in response to <br /> an invite you receive to join another party’s organization, your use of the Services will <br /> be governed by the terms of that party’s agreement with us and the terms of only the <br /> first 4 paragraphs of these Customer Terms. For example, you may be invited by <br /> another party to collaborate with such party on a project they are working on within <br /> the Services. When you work on such project within the Services, all materials, <br /> information, data, and other content you provide through the Services will be owned <br /> by such party under the terms of such party’s agreement with us. However, you <br /> represent and warrant to us that you have the right to grant such ownership rights to <br /> such party.

     Specific details regarding your subscription to the Services (such as <br /> cost, duration, and license limitations) will be selected or identified when you complete <br /> the online sign-up process on our website (the <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Sign-up Process”</span>). Once you sign-up for a <br /> free account or purchase a subscription to the Services through the Sign-up Process, we <br /> will provide you with the necessary information to access the Services and install the <br /> related software directly onto your computer hard drive. When you complete the Sign-up <br /> Process, you will be able to select the subscription plan that you wish to purchase or sign <br /> -up to use a free version of the Services. Your subscription will start on the date we make <br /> the Services available to you and continue for the period you select either during the Sign- <br /> up Process or at a later time in your Account Settings ( <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Subscription Period”</span> ). After you <br /> complete the Sign-up Process, you can access and make certain changes to the details of <br /> your subscription, e.g. upgrade or downgrade your subscription plan or add or remove <br /> Authorized Users, through the settings options in the accounts of Authorized Users you <br /> give administrative permissions to within the Services ( <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Account Settings”</span> ).

If we believe there is a violation of this <br /> Agreement that can be remedied by Customer’s removal of certain Customer Information, <br /> we may ask Customer to take direct action rather than intervene. However, we reserve the <br /> right to take further action (including suspending your use of or access to the Services or <br /> removing certain Customer Information), when we deem it reasonably appropriate if <br /> Customer does not take suitable action itself, or if we believe Customer is violating <br /> applicable law or there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or <br /> any of our other customers

  Each party ( <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Disclosing Party”</span> ) may disclose <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Confidential <br /> Information” </span>to the other party ( <span style={{fontWeight:"700"}}>“Receiving Party”</span> ) in connection with this Agreement, <br /> which is anything that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the <br /> nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure including all Order Forms, <br /> as well as non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. <br /> Confidential Information of Abstract includes the Abstract Materials. Confidential <br /> Information of Customer includes Customer Information. If something is labeled <br />“Confidential,” that’s a clear indicator to the Receiving Party that the material is <br /> confidential. Notwithstanding the above, Confidential Information does not include <br /> information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of any <br /> obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its <br /> disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing <br /> Party; (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the <br /> Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use <br /> or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

   <p style={{marginTop: "15px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>12.2 Protection and Use of Confidential Information:</span>
     The Receiving Party will (a) <br /> protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of <br /> care used to protect its own confidential or proprietary information of like importance, but in <br /> any case using no less than a reasonable degree of care, (b) limit access to the <br /> Confidential Information to those employees, affiliates, Subprocessors (as described in <br /> Section 10.2 below), agents, consultants, legal advisors, financial advisors, and contractors <br /> ( <span style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>“Representatives”</span> ) who need to know such information in connection with this <br /> Agreement and who are bound by  confidentiality and non-use obligations just as <br /> protective of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as the terms of this <br /> Agreement; (c) except as expressly set forth herein, will not disclose any of Disclosing <br /> Party’s Confidential Information to any third parties without the Disclosing Party’s prior <br /> written consent; and (d) will not use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information for any <br /> purpose other than to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. Nothing above will <br /> prevent either party from sharing Confidential Information with financial and legal <br /> advisors; provided, however, that the advisors are bound to confidentiality obligations at <br /> least as restrictive as those in this Agreement.

   <p style={{marginTop: "15px"}}> <span style={{fontWeight: "750", marginRight:"15px"}}>12.3 Compelled Access or Disclosure:</span>
    The Receiving Party may access or disclose <br /> Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is required by law; provided, however, <br /> that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled access or <br /> disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing <br /> Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the access or disclosure.

In the event we have a reasonable, good faith belief that an unauthorized <br /> party has accessed Personal Information, we will promptly notify Customer and will <br /> promptly investigate the incident. If such incident triggers any third-party notice <br /> requirements, Customer will be solely responsible for the timing, content, cost and <br />method of any such notice and compliance with applicable laws. Customer bears sole <br /> responsibility for adequate security, protection and backup of Personal Information when <br /> in Customer’s or its representatives’ or agents’ possession or control. We are not <br /> responsible, and Customer is fully responsible, for what Customer’s Authorized Users do <br /> with Personal Information.
